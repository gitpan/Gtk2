give a better name to the entry point for gtk-demo
make gtk-demo not show the 2.2 stuff when running on 2.0
should example programs be installed?
there are plenty of unbound apis, either because of lack of interest or
	lack of need -- these should be audited.

no typemap (and therefore no bindings) for
	GdkRgbCmap
	GScanner <- i'd consider this to be internal
	PangoEngineShape
	PangoCoverage
	PangoLayoutLine

what about decorated window stuff?

foreach callbacks (and possibly other types) need some doc on the callback
api/params.
