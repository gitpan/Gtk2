turn examples/colorselectiontest.pl into a proper t/* test
give a better name to the entry point for gtk-demo
make gtk-demo not show the 2.2 stuff when running on 2.0
should example programs be installed?
there are plenty of unbound apis, either because of lack of interest or
	lack of need -- these should be audited.

do string columns in GtkTreeModels do automatic memory management?
if not, do we need to automate it?  are we safe with sv strings?

no typemap (and therefore no bindings) for
	GdkRegion
	GdkRgbCmap
	GScanner
	PangoGlyph
	PangoEngineShape
	PangoCoverage
	PangoRectangle
	PangoLayoutLine
	PangoLayoutIter

many functions missing from GtkRc; no methods bound for GtkRcStyle

gdk_thread_init is supposed to be called before gtk_init.
probably should have another import option, -thread-init,
to avoid *always* enabling thread safety, since it will
be rare to have a multi-threaded perl gtk program until
perl threading is more mainstream.

what about decorated window stuff?
