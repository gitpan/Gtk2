Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.042
=================================

* Documentation fixes and improvements.  [muppet, Torsten, Jason Stirling]
* Fix silly bugs in examples.  [Thierry Vignaud]
* Hush nastygrams from test suite.  [muppet]

Overview of Changes in 1.041
============================

* SimpleList bugfixes; store, pop, shift, unshift, and splice now return the
  proper values.  [Ross]
* Fix incorrect code in examples.  [muppet]
* Doc updates.  [Torsten, Ross]
* Don't overwrite the Gtk2.pm docs with a Gtk2.pod.  Unfortunately, those 
  upgrading from source or CPAN will need to remove the stray Gtk2.pod from
  the perl library manually in order to get the correct docs from perldoc;
  the manpage should upgrade fine.  [Torsten]
* Test suite updates and fixes.  [Torsten, Ross]
* Fix miscellaneous issues.  [Thierry Vignaud, Cory Omand, muppet, Ross]

Overview of Changes in 1.040
============================

  Since 1.02x (the previous stable series)
  ----------------------------------------
  * Updated requirements:
    - Glib >= 1.040
    - ExtUtils::Depends >= 0.2  (required only at build time)
    - ExtUtils::PkgConfig >= 1.03  (require only at build time)
  * Add support for new objects and API in gtk+-2.4.0.
  * Derivation of Gtk2::CellRenderer has been reworked; it's much more sane
    now, but we retain backward compatibility with the 1.02x code.
  * It is now possible to implement GInterfaces in Perl code, so you can now
    implement your own Gtk2::TreeModels and Gtk2::CellEditables.  Examples
    are included.
  * The SPLICE operation is now supported on Gtk2::SimpleList's tied data.
  * New, standardized versioning API and documentation.
  * Documentation enhancements all around.
  * Huge test suite expansion and amazing increase in API coverage.
  * New utility module Gtk2::TestHelper wraps up some of the boilerplate
    involved in testing Gtk2-based modules.

  Since 1.0391
  ------------
  * Test fixes.  [Torsten]
  * Use INT2PTR to quell cast warnings.  [muppet]
  * Documentation updates.  [all]
  * Hide private symbols from ABI.  [muppet]
  * Add examples/dialog.pl  [Ross]
  * Assorted bits of code cleanup.  [muppet]

Overview of Changes in 1.0391
=============================

* Disavow the existence of gtk+ 2.3.x, bump all version checks to 2.4. [muppet]
* Add, document, and test Gtk2::GET_VERSION_INFO; rename
  Gtk2::Pango::get_version_info to Gtk2::Pango::GET_VERSION_INFO.  [muppet]
* New example, improved examples, improved commentary.  [Ross, muppet]
* Documentation improvements.
* Allow embedded \0s in property strings.  [Torsten]
* Test suite stuff.
* Portability fixes, and update the exports file for win32.  [muppet]

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.039
=================================

* New example, color_snooper.pl
* More tests.

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.038
=================================

* Despite the warning from Makefile.PL, this release marks an API freeze.
* Code sweep removed many FIXMEs and fixed lots of problems, and uncovered
  a large handful of missing trivial functions.
* Cleanup on examples.  [Ross]
* New bindings, with tests, for things new in gtk+ in the latest unstable
  release, and for things we found at the last minute while auditing 
  the code  [mostly Torsten]:
   Gtk2::ComboBoxEntry::new_text (new in 2.3.5)
   Gtk2::Entry::[gs]et_alignment
   Gtk2::FileChooser::[gs]et_use_preview_label (new in gtk+ 2.3.5)
   Gtk2::FileChooser::new_with_backend (new in gtk+ 2.3.5)
   Gtk2::Gdk::Event::handler_set
   Gtk2::Gdk::Event::set_state (and added setter capability to state())
   Gtk2::Gdk::Event::set_time (and added setter capability to time())
   Gtk2::MenuItem::toggle_size_allocate
   Gtk2::MenuItem::toggle_size_request
   Gtk2::Pango::Layout::[sg]et_auto_dir (new in pango 1.3.5)

   Gtk2::Window::activate_key
   Gtk2::Window::propagate_key_event
   Gtk2::draw_insertion_cursor
   Gtk2::main_do_event
  Removed API:
   Gtk2::FileChooser::[gs]et_folder_mode (removed from gtk+ in 2.3.5)
   Gtk2::Allocations have been replaced by Gtk2::Gdk::Rectangles; they
    were just reblessed rectangles anyway.
* Test fixes.  [muppet, Torsten, Ross]
* Random pod updates all over the place.  [muppet]
* Gtk2::CellRenderer now hides "this api is deprecated!" warnings unless env
  var GTK2PERL_DEBUG is set and true.  [muppet]
* Finally fixed Gtk2::Gdk::DragContext::find_window and friends.  [muppet]
* New regression test for custom TreeModel interface implementations.  There
  are several TODO tests that fail, as a reminder to muppet to fix them
  properly.  [Torsten]
* Build GdkX11.xs (and the associated Gtk2::Gdk::X11 namespace) only when
  linking against the x11 gtk+ target.  [muppet]
* Numerous bugfixes.  It was a busy weekend.  Some features important for
  deriving containers in Perl code have been punted for the 1.060 API freeze.

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.037
=================================

* Updated Glib requirement to 1.037.
* Decided on a versioning scheme, implemented it, and applied it.
  http://lists.gnome.org/archives/gtk-perl-list/2004-February/msg00085.html
  New functions: Gtk2->CHECK_VERSION, Gtk2::MAJOR_VERSION, Gtk2::MINOR_VERSION,
  Gtk2::MICRO_VERSION, Gtk2::major_version, Gtk2::minor_version,

* Added to parse_maps the ability to generate error domain registrations;
  use that for Gtk2's own error domains.  [muppet]
* Use a weakref rather than object data to keep Tooltips objects alive.
  [muppet, implementing yosh's suggestion]
* Pod fixes and enhancements.  [Ross]

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.035
=================================

* Updated Glib requirement to 1.035.
* Updated ExtUtils::Depends requirement to 0.200.

* Minor updates to example code.  [Torsten]
* As always, added more tests.  [Tortsen]

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.034
=================================

* Updated Glib requirement to 1.034.
* Updated ExtUtils::PkgConfig requirement to 1.03.
* Even yet still more tests, examples, and bugfixes.
* Improved (corrected?) handling of Gtk2::CellRenderer derivation; based on
  a more generic method for handling vfuncs as inheritable ALL_CAPS methods.
  Includes backward compatibility, plenty of documentation, and updated
  examples.  [muppet]
* Allow perl implementations of the Gtk2::CellEditable and Gtk2::TreeModel
  interfaces; two new examples included.  Huge thanks to Bjarne Steinsbo.

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.033
=================================

* Lots of new regresion tests, and exsting tests are more thorough
* apidoc POD updates.
* GdkCursor's type member now accessable.
* GdkKeys incorrect mapping fixed, unreg'd subclass warnings quelled.
* SimpleList now supports a column type markup, for pango marked-up text
* x/y event members are now available where they should be, GdkEvent doc 
  improved. corrected some invalid function -> package mappings.
* missing/TODO functions implemented in GdkDrawable
* Bug fix related to colormaps fixed in GdkGC 

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.031
=================================

* Updated Glib requirement to 1.031.
* Added binding support for objects and functions new in gtk+-2.3.x.  Not
  all tests are complete.  Updated gtk-demo and examples to use the new stuff
  if available.  This code will be protected by 2.4.0 version guards when
  gtk+-2.4.0 is finally released.  Note: The unstable-2-3-x-branch in CVS
  is now dead.  [muppet]
* New example in gtk-demo (ported from C) shows how to make hyperlinks in
  a TextView. [muppet, from gtk+]
* Converted all of the Gtk2::Gdk::Event accessors into combination accessors
  and mutators. [Ross]
* Provide a fallback implementation of Gtk2::Gdk::Event::new when linking
  against gtk+-2.0.x, so we can always create events (needed for synthesizing
  events in tests). [muppet]
* Even yet still more tests. [Torsten]
* Don't copy colors when accessing Style members; this makes it possible to
  change the colors in a style. [Torsten]
* Various little bugfixes, memory leak plugs, ornulls, doc updates, build
  enhancements, etc.

Overview of Changes from Gtk2 1.02x to 1.030
============================================

* All of the fixes on the 1.02x branch have been made here as well, including
  the 64-bit cleanliness stuff, the MessageDialog utf8 fix, and the SimpleList
  base issue that broke upgrades from really old gtk2-perl.
* Torsten has competely redone the test suite, more than doubling its size.
  Exhaustive is a good word.  Added Gtk2::TestHelper, which automates
  several tedious jobs for testing things based on Gtk2.
* Lots of general clean up.  Many small bugfixes (add ornull here, fix a broken
  call signature there, fix uninitialized variables all over the place, etc).
  Adjust ALIASed xsubs to remove invalid methods from the perl namespace.
  Never allow NULL to be passed to SvOK().
* New examples: how to use Perl threads and Gtk2 together safely; how to
  colorize rows in a SimpleList; how to add your own stock items; how to use
  inline XPM images.
* Add support for GdkRegions.  Improved support for GtkRcStyles.
* Added lots of other esoteric functions.  Our api coverage is creeping up.
* Move the implementation of the ItemFactory stuff from Perl to XS, and in
  the process fixed the bug that kept accelerators from showing up properly.
* Extended handling of GdkGeometry.  In addition to the method accessors,
  you can create the geom as a hash; the bindings will calculate the valid
  mask for you.
* Implement custom marshaller for the rows-reordered signal, making it
  usable.  (Patch from Roderich Schupp)
* Completed the implementation of SPLICE on SimpleList's TiedList class.
