=head1 NAME

Gtk2 - Perl interface to the 2.x series of the Gimp Toolkit library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Gtk2 -init;
  # Gtk2->init; works if you didn't use -init on use
  my $window = Gtk2::Window->new ('toplevel');
  my $button = Gtk2::Button->new ('Quit');
  $button->signal_connect (clicked => sub { Gtk2->main_quit });
  $window->add ($button);
  $window->show_all;
  Gtk2->main;

=head1 ABSTRACT

Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ widget set.  This module
allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management
in C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Gtk2 module allows a perl developer to use the Gtk+ graphical user
interface library.  Find out more about Gtk+ at http://www.gtk.org.

The GTK+ Reference Manual is also a handy companion when writing Gtk
programs in any language.  http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/
The perl bindings follow the C API very closely, and the C reference
documentation should be considered the canonical source.

To discuss gtk2-perl, ask questions and flame/praise the authors,
join gtk-perl-list@gnome.org at lists.gnome.org.

Also have a look at the gtk2-perl website and sourceforge project page,
http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<perl>(1), L<Glib>(3pm).

L<Gtk2::Gdk::Keysyms>(3pm) contains a hash of key codes, culled from
gdk/gdkkeysyms.h

L<Gtk2::api>(3pm) describes how to map the C API into perl, and some of the
important differences in the perl bindings.

L<Gtk2::Helper>(3pm) contains stuff that makes writing Gtk2 programs
a little easier.

L<Gtk2::SimpleList>(3pm) makes the GtkListStore and GtkTreeModel a I<lot>
easier to use.

L<Gtk2::Pango>(3pm) exports various little-used but important constants you
may need to work with pango directly.

L<Gtk2::index>(3pm) lists the autogenerated api documentation pod files
for Gtk2.

Gtk2 also provides code to make it relatively painless to create perl
wrappers for other GLib/Gtk-based libraries.  See L<Gtk2::CodeGen>,
L<ExtUtils::PkgConfig>, and L<ExtUtils::Depends>.  If you're writing bindings,
you'll probably also be interested in L<Gtk2::devel>, which is a supplement
to L<Glib::devel> and L<Glib::xsapi>.  The Binding Howto, at
http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/doc/binding_howto.pod.html, ties it all
together.
